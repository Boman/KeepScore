Overview
========
KeepScore is a free and open-source score-keeping app for Android.  Feel free to file bugs on the GitHub page or branch the code yourself!  Just send me a merge request and I'll try to incorporate your changes into the app on the Android Market.

More details about the app can be found on [my website][3] or the [Google Play Store][4].
